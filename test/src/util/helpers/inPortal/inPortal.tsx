// use client makes sure it ONLY runs on the client side not like before where it runs on both client and server
// We need use client since even with noSSRWrapper the server will render server components
// This means it will be run on server even though no ssr before being sent to client as pure html. This is why we need to use client
// But this only creates a client slot where if you have later server content you can still take advantage html sent to client
