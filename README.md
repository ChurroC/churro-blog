## Churro Standards:

Going to have folder for each component to keep everything seperate and if a component has client and server interveaing I can keep it all in one folder. This also allows for easy dynamic no ssr imports in baralleling.

Use bun run add COMPONENT_NAME to create a new component in a folder. Use --dir for having folder in places like Context.

Hooks are useComponent.hook.js

Going to use bun and turbopack to bleed irresponsibly

Going to try to make most components and utils by myself

## Need to do (ramblings in my mind):

for header start doing dropdowns for lang which has a searchable option and theme.

Maybe add an animation to sun to moon.

Try to get fusion model explosion and think of way to integrate into site [text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrIEddahJM8)

when you hover over button have the size chane but not text like josh comeau for example in theme siwtcher

fix duplicate class issues

chaneg theme conetxt to have context in get

Add millio.js after testing speed increase and maybe try the compiler too until the react one "comes out"

## Info

Just for myself but useHasMounted for when you dont want one component server rendred but children server rendered like theme context.

Use the noSSRWrapper when you don't want children server rendered either.
